                <h4>Mortgage Broker</h4>
                <p>
                    Unless you have been through the financing process for apartments at least a couple of times, it&rsquo;s recommended to work with mortgage
                    broker.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While you can generally expect to pay 1 point to the broker for his or her services, the fee can be well worth it if you are working with a
                    professional broker who has solid relationships with several lenders. The broker&rsquo;s service can sometimes make the difference as to
                    whether
                    the financing for your deal goes through.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A good mortgage broker can usually tell you if he or she can place your loan after spending just to fifteen minutes with you on the phone.
                    The
                    broker knows what questions to ask to qualify your property and which lender is likely to be the most interested in financing it.
                </p>

                <h4>Underwriting Guidelines</h4>
                <p>
                    More often than not, a property under review will not completely fit into the lender&rsquo;s box - meaning that many properties will meet
                    most of
                    the established criteria, but it is rare when they meet 100 percent of the lender&rsquo;s guidelines. Lenders therefore have to take into
                    consideration what are known as <i>additional compensating factors.</i> For example, suppose a lander has set 680 as the minimum FICO score,
                    and
                    the borrower&rsquo;s score is only 640. A valid compensating factor would be that the net operating income generated by the property exceeds
                    the
                    lender&rsquo;s requirements enough to increase the amount of cash available to service the loan. In other words, if the DSCR minimum
                    requirement
                    is 1.20, but the income from the property is high enough to yield a ratio of 1.35, this fact would be favorably considered and might be
                    sufficient to offset the borrower&rsquo;s lower credit score.
                </p>

                </p>

                <h4>Reserve Requirements</h4>
                <p>
                    Portion of the income is used to cover any capital improvements to the apartment complex. Lenders will often figure into their calculations
                    a
                    budgeted amount deemed appropriate to make necessary capital improvements. The reserve requirement is established on an annual basis, and
                    often
                    is broken down into a per-unit figure, such as $250 per unit per year. Under this scenario, on a 100-unit apartment complex, you would have
                    a
                    total of $25,000 budgeted for improvements.
                </p>

                <h4>Lender Interview Questions</h4>
                <p>
                    Interview potential lenders early. Tell them what you want to do and show them your financial ability and sincerity. Find out what they are
                    looking for in the deals they make and what do they need from you.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Do you arrange engineering and environmental inspection, or do I need to do it?
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If lender, how much will it cost me, and what do engineering and environmental inspections include? Will they share a copy of
                                that
                                report with you?
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Can you give me a list of your preferred companies, and what third party-reports, ex; Environmental, PCA etc, do you require?
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Do you handle title inspection, or who must do it, ex; your attorney, title company?</li>
                    <li>
                        Can you send me a list of required documents for the property and the borrower? If no, then ask:
                        <ul>
                            <li>What property financial information do you require (ex; net income statement, rent roll etc.)?</li>
                            <li>
                                What other property information do you require, for example:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Sample of the current lease</li>
                                    <li>Map of the general surroundings</li>
                                    <li>A site plan showing the layout and building configuration</li>
                                    <li>Floor plans of the units to be rented</li>
                                    <li>Photos of the property exterior and interior</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>What borrower information do you require?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Can you send me an underwriting guidelines list? If no, then ask:
                        <ul>
                            <li>What is the maximum loan to value (LTV) ratio you require?</li>
                            <li>What is the minimum debt service coverage (DSCR) ratio you require?</li>
                            <li>What loan terms do you offer (15, 25, 30 years)?</li>
                            <li>What amortization periods do you offer (20, 25, 30 years)?</li>
                            <li>What replacement reserve amount per unit do you require to set aside every year?</li>
                            <li>What is the minimum number of years of property financials do you require?</li>
                            <li>What is the max vacancy rate do you require?</li>
                            <li>What is the max property management fee rate do you require?</li>
                            <li>What is the max property age in years do require?</li>
                            <li>
                                What are the loan provisions, recourse or non-recourse?
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Recourse: </strong>Borrower is personally liable for the outstanding debt, for example; property loan is $6
                                        million
                                        bank sells property for $5 million, lander can go after borrower&rsquo;s personal assets for remaining $1 million.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Non-Recourse: </strong>Borrower is not personally liable for the outstanding debt.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Do you have a list of property structure items that will disqualify property from financing?
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                For example, if the apartment building you are buying has aluminum wiring, you absolutely will not be able to get financing from
                                some
                                landers, as they consider this type of wiring to be a fire hazard.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Do you impose any penalties for prepaying a loan before expiration of its term?</li>
                    <li>How much do you charge for the closing costs?</li>
                    <li>Does state in which property is located matter?</li>
                    <li>Ask reference for the commercial property insurance broker.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Convince Lender</h4>
                <p>
                    Write up the results of your inspection, including an estimate of whatever repairs your property manager/contractor says should be done
                    right
                    away. Include it along with the financial statements in your loan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To establish experience and competency, submit a business plan (of sorts) along your loan application. Illustrate the managerial changes
                    that you
                    will execute to increase the property&rsquo;s cash flows and boost its value. Convince the lender that you understand the market and can
                    price an
                    position your rentals to attract a well-defined target market of tenants who will prefer the units that you offer relative to those of your
                    competition.
                </p>

                <h4>Lender Required Documents</h4>
                <p>
                    Because you have built a relationship with your lender, you already know what he is looking for, both in a property and in your application.
                    This, again, will save you considerable time and aggravation during the escrow period. Here are some documents lender will want to see from
                    you:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Loan Application Form</strong> - A novice investor, even one buying through a partnership or other corporate structure, will be
                        treated much like a home buyer. Expect to file that usual mountain of intrusive paperwork, including income tax returns, employment
                        verification and personal financial statement.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Purchase Contract</strong> - This should include all agreements between the buyer and the seller.</li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Financial Documents of the Building</strong> - This should include the balance and income statements, and the last three years
                        of the
                        rent rolls.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Leases</strong> - You should expect to show copies of all the tenants&rsquo; leases.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Other</h4>
                <p>
                    Better to have your attorney and mortgage broker scrutinize the loan paperwork before you sign. After reading it a number of times,
                    it&rsquo;s
                    easy to miss items that could have a negative effect later, should something go wrong.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>
                        <i>An important note:</i> Always try to negotiate a one-time assumption at no cost to the new buyer, especially if the loan has
                        favorable
                        terms.
                    </strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Go over your LLC structure with lander when shopping for loan to make sure lander has no problems with that. In some cases you may need an
                    attorney's letter to lender and/or title company stating that you are the actual person owning Wyoming holding LLC.
