                <h4>Option vs. Right of First Refusal</h4>
                <p>
                    An option is a right to purchase property at a set price for a fixed period of time, whereas a right of first refusal is a right to purchase
                    property only if it is offered for sale in the future.
                </p>

                <h4>Option</h4>
                <p>
                    An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer
                    time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning, and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed,
                    the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer,
                    the buyer is not obligated to purchase.
                </p>

                <h4>Right of First Refusal</h4>
                <p>
                    The right of a person to have the first opportunity to either purchase or lease real property. Unlike an option, however, the holder of a
                    right of first refusal has no right to purchase until the owner actually offers the property for sale or entertains an offer to purchase
                    from some third party. At that point, the holder may match the offer. If the owner first offers the property to the party holding the right
                    of first refusal, and this person refuses, then the owner is free to offer to any third party at that price or higher. In a lease situation,
                    a right of first refusal might give the tenant the right either to purchase the property, if offered for sale, or to renew the lease or
                    lease adjoining space.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This right of first refusal is clearly more advantageous to the tenant than it is to the landlord as this property is less marketable than
                    one without such a right. However, it may encourage the tenant to make improvements that the tenant might not otherwise have made. Under an
                    option to purchase, the tenant can decide whether or not to exercise the option at a fixed price during the option period. In a right of
                    first refusal, however, the holder can exercise the right only if the owner has offered to sell or lease the property or has entertained a
                    bona fide offer by a third person to purchase or lease the property.
