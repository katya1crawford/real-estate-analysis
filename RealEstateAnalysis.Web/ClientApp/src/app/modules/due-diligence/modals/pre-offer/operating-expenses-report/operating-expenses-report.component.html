                    This report will what and how expenses are; any trends that may be occurring such as electrical usage, elevator and/or HVAC repairs,
                    continuous
                    maintenance issues, i.e. roof repairs, plumbing issues, etc. It will also indicate where you can implement cost cutting measures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What you&rsquo;re looking for are the &quot;red flags&quot; that point to recurring problems and expenses so you can pay special attention
                    in investigating those issues.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Be sure to question any large amounts and ask for detailed back up information, such as receipts, work orders, certificates of completion
                    (if necessary); anything that helps you to better understand what has been performed so that you can satisfy yourself as to whether the
                    issue
                    have been addressed or just &quot;band-aid&quot; applied to take the cheapest way out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Do not assume anything. When in doubt ask.</i> You need to know all the answers to fully understand what has been done in the building
                    and/or what needs to be addressed. This could have a major negative impact on the investment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong><i>An Important Note:</i></strong> Call the contractors who performed the work on the repairs and maintenance at the property as
                    well as
                    current vendors who perform routine maintenance, such as HVAC and elevators. Ask them if there are any problems or issues that they can shed
                    light on for you. You would be surprised how much they&rsquo;re willing to share.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Benchmark the expenses against comparable properties in the area so you determine if the expenses are in line. Talk to property management
                    companies in the area. This is a worthwhile exercise because it will help you in determining if you&rsquo;re on track with the expenses
                    you&rsquo;re using, or if they&rsquo;re too high, you need to know what has to be done to bring them more in line.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Make sure numbers match what&rsquo;s on income statement.
