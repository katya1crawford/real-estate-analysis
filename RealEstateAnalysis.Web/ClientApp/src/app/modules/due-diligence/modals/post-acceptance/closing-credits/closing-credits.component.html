                    Closing credits most often consist of prorated credits for rental income, prepaid rent, security deposits, and taxes. The time of the month
                    your closing is held can have a significant impact on the credits you are entitled to as a buyer. Suppose you close on the very first day of
                    the month. Although you will be entitled to receive the full month&rsquo;s rent at the time of closing, assuming rents are due on the first
                    of the month, chances are the seller will have collected very little of the rental income yet. Most land lords provide a two-to-three-day
                    grace period before rents are considered late. If the seller were to give credit for the full month, this would put the seller in the
                    precarious position of having to collect the reminder of the rent after the day of closing when he or she is no longer the owner. It is
                    better to wait until the fifth of the month or so. By then, over 95 percent of all rents should have been collected and as a buyer,
                    you&rsquo;ll be entitled to receive a prorated credit for 25 days&rsquo; worth of rent without having to expend the time and effort to
                    collect them. Depending on the monthly revenues generated by the apartment complex, the credit due from rents collected can be quite
                    substantial. Take a look at the following example:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-style-none">
                    <li>100 units &times; $600/unit average rent = $60,000/month</li>
                    <li>(25 &divide; 30) &times; $60,000 = $50,000 closing credit for rental income</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Conversely, closing at the end of the month, say on the twenty-eighth, would have the following effect:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-style-none">
                    <li>100 units &times; $600/unit average rent = $60,000/month</li>
                    <li>(2 &divide; 30) &times; $60,000 = $4,000 closing credit for rental income</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    By studying this simple example, you can see the potential impact of closing at the beginning of the month versus closing at the end of the
                    month. In this case, you would have had to come to the closing table with $46,000 less by closing on the fifth rather than the
                    twenty-eighth.
                    Also, prepaid interest payment to the lender would be greater at the beginning of the month, which would partially offset the difference
                    collected in rental income.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While timing does effect the amount of rental income received at closing. It has no effect on the credit you are entitled to for security
                    deposit.
                </p>
                <ul class="list-style-none">
                    <li>100 &times; $300 average security deposit = $30,000</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In property taxes case, if you purchase property in the area where property taxes are paid in arrears, you will receive a prorated credit
                    from
                    the seller at closing, because the seller&rsquo;s liability for unpaid taxes is transferred to you. Your lender may, however, require that
                    funds
                    be set aside in an escrow account. In that case, the cash credit is transferred to the lender.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the area where your property is located requires that taxes be paid in advance, you will be required to give the seller a prorated credit
                    at
                    closing, because the seller already paid the taxes for the given time period. This transfer is made between the seller and the buyer only.
                    No
                    lender is involved under these circumstances; however, the lender may require that an additional two months&rsquo; prepaid or so be set up
                    in an
                    escrow account.
