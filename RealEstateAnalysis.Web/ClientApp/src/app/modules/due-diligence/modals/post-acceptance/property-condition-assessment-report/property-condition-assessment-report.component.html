                    Make sure Property Condition Assessment (PCA) report is done. If available, also obtain PCA report that was done when current owner
                    purchased the
                    property. It will give you an idea of which issues were outstanding when current owners purchased the property as well as what has been
                    fixed or
                    upgraded since their ownership. Make sure that whoever you choose to conduct you PCA report is aware of this report, as well as, any issues
                    that are of concern to you such as the elevators, HVAC, roof, etc. Ask them to pay special attention to the issues that are of your concern
                    and call you with their assessment of those issues when they are finished inspecting the property.
                </p>

                    Although you do not need to be present for the inspection, it&rsquo;s better that you are. Walk, crawl, climb, and touch every inch of the
                    property as the inspector does, asking questions along the way. By doing this, you will be able to get a better idea of exactly what is
                    wrong with the property so you can make the best decision on what you want to do with the problems you find. You may get a 30-page
                    (or longer!) report from the inspector, but it can be hard to tell from a written description had bad something really is. The report may
                    say something scary like &quot;illegal and dangerous wiring in bedroom two,&quot; but without being there to ask more questions, you
                    might not realize the issue is simply two wires being mixed up in the light fixture - a 30-second repair!
                </p>
                <p>Make sure following inspections are covered through PCA report or other reports:</p>

                        The condition of heating, ventilation, and cooling systems and the equipment service and maintenance records. What is the repair history
