                        <strong>Phase I:</strong> Reports are basic reports that are done by physical inspection of the property, as well are review of
                        historical
                        records and aerials to determine if there are any environmental concerns or issues; if so, what recommendations are made? There can
                        include
                        lab samples collected to determine if asbestos or other contaminants are present.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Phase II:</strong> Reports are done because of the recommendations made in the Phase I Report to further determine the extent of
                        any
                        suspected concerns, issues or foundings. Also, ground borings could be recommended to pull oil samples, if there are suspected ground
                        contaminants such as gasoline, petroleum products or tetracycline from previous use of the property, for example, a gas station or dry
                        cleaners.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Phase III:</strong> Reports are the recommendations for the remediation and removal of any contaminants found as a result of
                        conducting the Phase II investigation.
