                    One of the purposes of this entire inspection process is to put an estimated cost to each item in the list and arrive at a total number that
                    you
                    can take back to the seller and discuss. If you bring these issues to the seller&rsquo;s attention in most case they will be fixed before
                    you
                    close, or you will get reduction in price. That save you money and in some cases, lots of it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do not only include cost of repairs into price reduction, but also include lost revenue from units being down for however long before they
                    are
                    rented.
                </p>

                    Use discovered deferred maintenance and needed repairs information in deciding to keep or fire existing property management company, if
                    it&rsquo;s managed by one.
