                A Limited Partnership is similar to a General Partnership with the exception that it has two types of partners. The first type is a general
                partner who is responsible for managing the partnership. As with a General Partnership, the general partner of a Limited Partnership has broad
                powers to obligate the partnership and is also personally liable for the business&rsquo;s debts and claims. If there is more than one general
                partner involved, they are all jointly and severally liable, meaning that a creditor can go after just one partner (or both partners) for the
                entire debt. (But as discussed below under Limited Liability, general partners can be protected in a Limited Partnership.) The second type of
                partner in a Limited Partnership is a limited partner. By definition, a limited partner is limited to his or her contribution of capital to the
                partnership and may not become actively involved in the business of the partnership. In the event a limited partner does become active in
                management, he or she may become personally responsible as a general partner.
            </p>
            <p>
                The beauty of the limited, partnership structure is that with as little as 2% ownership, the general partner can exert complete control over the
                affairs of the limited partnership. This is an excellent way to handle properties with family members or investors involved. As limited partners
                they can be prevented from asserting demands or control over the investment. If your kids are a challenge and want you to sell the 4 plex so
                that they can hit the road with the band you, as general partner, can say no. As general partner, you are in control. The kids can own 50% or
                70% or 90% of the limited partnership interests and as long as you are the general partner that 4 plex will not be sold. Absent fraud, the
                general partner reigns supreme.
            </p>
            <p>
                The problem with properly structuring a limited partnership is that it requires the formation and maintenance of not one but two entities. To do
                it right you need not only a limited partnership but a corporation or LLC to serve as the general partner. (Remember, if you serve as the
                general partner in your individual capacity, you are personally responsible for everything).
            </p>
            <p>
                To understand the management structure of a Limited Partnership, as well as an LLC and a Corporation, the following chart may be useful:
            </p>
            <p><img src="../../../../../assets/entity-structure/limited-parnership-vs-other.jpg" class="img-fluid img-thumbnail" /></p>
            <p>
                To organize a Limited Partnership, you must file a Certificate of Limited Partnership, otherwise known as an LP-1, with the Secretary of
                State&rsquo;s office. This document contains certain information about the general partner and, depending on the state, limited partners, and is
                akin to the filing of Articles of Incorporation for a Corporation or Articles of Organization for an LLC.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Limited Partnership offers certain unique advantages not always found in other entities. These features include:
            </p>

            <h4>Limited Liability</h4>
            <p>
                Limited partners (limiteds) are not responsible for the partnership debts beyond the amount of their capital contribution or contribution
                obligation. So, as discussed, unless they become actively involved, the limiteds are protected.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a rule, general partners are personally liable for all partnership debts. However, as was alluded to above, there is a way to protect the
                general partner of a Limited Partnership.
            </p>
            <p>
                To reduce liability exposure, Corporations or LLCs are formed to serve as general partners of the Limited Partnership. In this way, the
                liability of the general partner, is encapsulated in a limited liability entity. Assume a creditor sues a Limited Partnership over a business
                debt and seeks to hold the general partner liable If the general partner is a Corporation or LLC that is where the liability ends. While the
                assets within the corporate or LLC entity may be exposed to a creditor&rsquo;s claim a useful and popular strategy is to hold few or no assets
                in the corporate general partner. In this way the personal assets of the owners of the corporate general partner are protected and not at risk.
            </p>
            <p>
                As such, many, if not most, Limited Partnerships are organized using corporate or LLC general partners. In this way, both the limited and
                general partners achieve limited liability protection.
            </p>

            <h4>Restrictions on Transfer</h4>
            <p>
                By definition, limiteds may not participate in management, therefore the general partner maintains complete control. In many cases, the general
                partner will hold only two percent of the partnership interest but will be able to assert 100 percent control over the partnership. This feature
                is valuable in estate planning situations where a parent is gifting or has gifted Limited Partnership interests to his children.
            </p>

            <h4>Retained Management</h4>
            <p>
                The ability to restrict the transfer of Limited or General Partnership interests to outside persons is a valuable feature of the Limited
                Partnership. Do you want to keep unknown parties or undesirable ex-spouses out of your company? <u>Through a written Limited Partnership
                    Agreement, rights of first refusal, prohibited transfers and conditions to permitted transfers are instituted to restrict the free
                    transferability of partnership interests.</u> It should be noted that LLCs can also afford beneficial restrictions on transfer. <u>These
                    restrictions are crucial for achieving the creditor protection and estate and gift tax advantages afforded by Limited Partnerships.</u>
            </p>

            <h4>Protection from Creditors</h4>
            <p>
                Creditors of a partnership can only reach the partnership assets andâ€”the assets of the general partner, which is limited by using a corporate
                general partner. Thus if, for example, you and your family owned three separate apartment buildings, it may be prudent to compartmentalize these
                assets into three separate Limited Partnerships, using one separate corporate general partner. If a litigious tenant sued over conditions at one
                of the properties, the other two buildings would not be exposed to satisfy any claims.
            </p>
            <p>
                Creditors of the individual partners can only reach that person&rsquo;s partnership interest and not the partnership assets themselves. Assume
                you&rsquo;ve gifted a Limited Partnership interest equal to 25 percent in one of the apartment building partnerships to your son. He is young
                and forgets to obtain automobile insurance. Of course, in this example he gets in a car accident and has a judgment creditor looking for assets.
                This creditor cannot reach the apartment building asset itself because it is in the Limited Partnership. He can only reach the money earned by
                your son&rsquo;s 25 percent Limited Partnership interest, and then only, in many states, through the charging order procedure. Charging orders,
                which do not offer an easy path to payment, are discussed more fully in Chapter Seven, and are not favored by creditors.
            </p>

            <h4>Family Wealth Transfers</h4>
            <p>
                With proper planning, transfers of family assets from one generation to the next can occur at discounted rates. As a general rule, the IRS, at
                the time of this writing, allows one individual to give another individual a gift of $15,000 per year. Any gifts valued at over $15,000 are
                subject to a gift tax, but may also be counted as a lifetime gift, which allows $11.2 million (at least through 2025) in gifts during your life
                and at death. As such, you have two tracks of gifting: the annual (currently $15,000 per year) and the lifetime (currently $11.2 million per
                spouse). In the estate-planning arena, senior family members may be advised to give assets away during their lifetimes so that estate taxes of
                up to 40 percent are minimized. Please note that Congress is always prone to change these rules so stay current with your advisors.
            </p>

            <h4>Flexibility</h4>
            <p>
                The Limited Partnership provides a great deal of flexibility. A written Limited Partnership Agreement can be drafted to tailor the business and
                family planning requirements of any situation. And there are very few statutory requirements that cannot be changed or eliminated through a
                well-drafted Limited Partnership Agreement.
            </p>

            <h4>Taxation</h4>
            <p>
                Limited Partnerships, like General Partnerships, are flow-through tax entities. The Limited Partnership files an informational partnership tax
                return (IRS Form 1065, United States Partnership Return of Income, the same as a General Partnership) and each limited receives an IRS Schedule
                K-1 (1065), Partner&rsquo;s Share of Income, Credits and Deductions, from the Limited Partnership. Each limited then files the K-1 with his or
                her individual IRS 1040 tax return.
